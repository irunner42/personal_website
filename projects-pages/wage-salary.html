    <h1>Welcome to the wage calculator project page.</h1>
    <h2>Why I made it?</h2>
    <p style="width:85%; font-size: 1.15rem;">While working at Tesco my friend showed me how he calculates the wage (cause you know like 70% of us live from paycheck to paycheck) and he 
        used excel but I thought: "Why not make an app, learn and make at the very least something useful?". So, I coded that using python Tkinter, unfortunately
        my skills are not great so far,so I strive to get better in the future!
    </p>
    <img src="/personal_website/items-project/python.png" >
    <p style="width:85%; font-size: 1.15rem;">So the main part is those three files that are highlighted in the red squares. First, <strong>Functions.py</strong>
        our main file, most logic that is not impacting GUI is written there, system works based off txt files and makes dictionary out of the data there
        that then is used to see what days are vacation days, what mode users selected, etc. Second, <strong>Calculations.py</strong> that file handles the new window that
        opens when you press the "Calculate" button, it creates a new window where it gives approximate salary that you should get in the end of the month.
        Taxes are based in Slovakia, so in your country it might be different, but here we are talking about 19% off your wage taking into the account that in Slovakia
        <strong>479.48</strong> euros is the base that cannot be taxed since it is the living minimum set by the government of Slovakia in 2025.
        Lastly, <strong>GUI.py</strong> that one is pretty simple, it is just the main window itself with the dynamic calendar, let's you pick the date you worked,
        what type of work was it (normal, overtime or vacation) and then you type in hours you worked from to.
    </p>
    <img src="/personal_website/items-project/main_window.png" >
    <p style="width:85%; font-size: 1.15rem;">
        Those two inputs indicated Uvazok (Part-time or full-time) and your current monthly Mzda (salary) that is wrtten in your contract with the company.
        On the screenshot I have entered the hours I used to work 20 hours per week and 678 euros per month gross.
    </p>
    <img src="/personal_website/items-project/choose_window.png" >
    <p style="width:85%; font-size: 1.15rem;">
        After picking a date, it becomes gray as that indicates you worked that day and the new window pops up where you have to write start of your shift
        and the end time of your shift. There are three different modes (Normal,Overtime and Vacation). The diffence is in the Vacation and Overtime.
        Vacation doesn's give 4.87 euro of gastro (food pay) that is granted in Slovakia after your shift exceeds 4 hours time (it is not taxed). Overtime at least at Tesco's 
        is calculated by your hour rate * 25% of the average of three previous months you have worked. <strong>Fond hodin</strong> part is also important as it calculates your hour 
        rate month by month, even though you, for instance, have 20 hours written per week, each month has <strong>different</strong> amount of working days, so 
        your hour pay will get lower in the months like October that has 23 working days meaning that you have to work 92 hours.
    </p>
     <img src="/personal_website/items-project/final_calc.png" >
     <p style="width:85%; font-size: 1.15rem;">
        Final part is the <strong>calculations</strong> part. Here I have worked 94 hours and got that approximately I will get 664.57 (without gastro) + 
        it shows all the taxes you pay and exactly what. For now the design ain't great but since it is alpha version and done by a guy who barely has 
        time to cook food for himself, it will take some time to make polished and perhaps a very helpful tool for workers in Slovakia that want to 
        manage their finances.
